## Run the tutorials locally


All of the code use in this repo is python-based.
The library requirements can be installed by executing the following command using
[`pip`](pypi.org/project/pip) in the command line:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

If you have [`conda`] you can also install the libraries by creating a conda environment.
To do this, run the following command: 

```conda env create -f env2.yml```

## Repository folders

This repository is broken up into several directories and subdirectories. Please
see each directory for information regarding each file. 


### **`notebooks`** 

This is where the tutorials live. 

### **`datasets`** 

All of the data is stored here. The datasets contain what you'll need to run the
tutorials and/or explore the results from our paper.
