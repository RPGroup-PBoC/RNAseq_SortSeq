Abstract: >
  While advances in DNA sequencing have enabled widespread access to this
  groundbreaking technology, even in the case of arguably one of biologyâ€™s best
  understood organisms, the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, for approximately 65%
  of the promoters we remain completely ignorant of their regulation. Until we
  have cracked this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write genomes
  will remain haphazard. We introduce a new method for unraveling the regulatory
  genome of a broad array of genes in *E. coli*. Specifically, we show that
  we can extract previously known regulatory information and unmask the regulatory
  architectures for more than 80 uncharacterized promoters, and in many of those
  cases, which transcription factors mediate this regulation. The method introduced
  here clears a path for fully characterizing the regulatory genome of model
  organisms, with the potential of moving on to an array of other microbes of
  ecological and medical relevance.
