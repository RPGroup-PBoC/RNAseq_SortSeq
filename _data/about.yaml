Abstract: >
  While advances in DNA sequencing have enabled widespread access to this
  groundbreaking technology, even in the case of arguably one of biology's
  best understood organisms, the bacterium *Escherichia coli, 35\% of
  its genes are of unknown function. Moreover, for $\approx$ 65\% of the
  promoters in *E. coli* we remain completely ignorant of their regulation.
  Until we have cracked this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write 
  genomes at will remain incomplete and haphazard. In this paper, we introduce
  a new method for unraveling the regulatory genome of a broad array of genes 
  in *E. coli*. Specifically, we show that we can extract known regulatory 
  information for a set of known genes and unmask the regulatory architectures 
  for more than 80 uncharacterized promoters, and in many of those cases, 
  which transcription factors mediate this regulation. Though the entirety 
  of our array of discoveries and dataset are provided in online format, in 
  the paper itself we focus on several case studies that exhibit the power of 
  our methods to uncover the regulatory genome, featuring broadly acting 
  transcriptional regulators (GlpR and FNR) and a case study in multiplexing 
  of a bacterial promoter. The method introduced here clears a path for fully 
  characterizing the regulatory genome of model organisms and then moving on 
  to an array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.
